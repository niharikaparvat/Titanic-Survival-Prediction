# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, class, sex, and other personal details. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not using historical data from the Titanic disaster.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale numerical features.
- **Model Building:** Build machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine to predict survival.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Visualize data trends, correlations, and feature importance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - jupyterlab (optional, for notebooks)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle’s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition.
- The dataset consists of features like passenger class, age, sex, number of siblings/spouses aboard, and whether the passenger survived or not.

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data:

   ```python
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the predictive model:

   ```python
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:

   ```python
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

4. Make predictions:

   ```python
   python predict.py
   ```

## Example

- The system can predict the survival of passengers based on the features provided. Run the `predict.py` script with input data to get predictions.
